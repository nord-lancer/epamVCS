[Verse 1]
Where dead men lies, I'm paralyzed, my brother's eyes are gone
And he shall be buried here, nameless marks his grave
Mother home, get a telegram and shed a tear of grief
Mud and blood, in foreign land, trying to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is this greatness I've been told?
This is the lies that we've been sold
Is this a worthy sacrifice?

[Chorus]
Great war, and I cannot take more
Great tour, I keep on marching on
I play the great score, there will be no encore
Great war, the war to end all wars

[Verse 2]
I'm standing here, I'm full of fear, with bodies at my feet
Over there in the other trench, bullets wear my name
Lead ahead as the captain said and show them no remorse
Who am I to understand what have I become?

[Pre-Chorus]
I do my duties, pay the price
I'll do the worthy sacrifice
I know my deeds are not in vain

[Chorus]
Great war, and I cannot take more
Great tour, I keep on marching on
I play the great score, there will be no encore
Great war, the war to end all wars

[Bridge]
And feet by feet
We pay the price of a mile here
Though men are falling, we see heroes rise
We face the heat
As we are fighting until the dawn
So follow me and we will write our own history

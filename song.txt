Where dead men lies, I'm paralyzed, my brother's eyes are gone
And he shall be buried here, nameless marks his grave
Mother home, get a telegram and shed a tear of grief
Mud and blood, in foreign land, trying to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is this greatness I've been told?
This is the lies that we've been sold
Is this a worthy sacrifice?

[Chorus]
Great war, and I cannot take more
Great tour, I keep on marching on
I play the great score, there will be no encore
Great war, the war to end all wars
